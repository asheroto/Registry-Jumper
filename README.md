# Improvements

- **Project Renamed**: The original [Chrome Registry Jumper](https://github.com/hmemcpy/ChromeRegJump) is now renamed to Registry Jumper.
- **Prefix Filtering**: The context menu option to open with Regedit is now only shown for valid registry keys (HKLM, HKCU, etc.). Selecting non-registry keys will not display the RegJump option in the context menu.
- **Automated Installation**: An automatic installation script has been created to download RegJump and register the Chrome Native Messaging host.
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Improved debugging features and overall code quality.
